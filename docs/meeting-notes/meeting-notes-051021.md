# 5 Oct Meeting Notes

## Consultation

* Reminders:
  * Iteration 2 submission: 18 Oct
  * Demo and consult on the week: week 11 (penalty of 2 marks)
  * Week 10 presentation
* No code needed but best to complete the iteration 2 stuff by iteration 2 end
  * Optimisation not required yet
  * `Affects*` can be delayed
  * Minimally `Next`,`Next*`, `with`
* Handling calls on PKB: the fastest way is to form a topo ordering of the procedure and
  update from the back.
* `Affects` should make use of `Next` algo.
* `with` clause can be thought of a normal relationship with 2 arguments.
* Intermediate table more advisable than DFS because it is easier to implement.
  * Intermediate solution is easier and good enough
  * Can use both
* Extensions:
  * OR clause and local variable is good
  * Just need to state what it is and how you would implement it.

## Team Meeting

* Zhia Yang: `with`
